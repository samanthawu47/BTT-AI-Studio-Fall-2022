USA for UNHCR is an organization that facilitates aid from the public to refugees. We are tasked with the problem of predicting which subscribers on an email list will become donors.

Our approach is to utilize binary classification models to predict who will become a donor after organizing and cleaning the data based on user IDs. We are also visualizing the behavior of subscribers chronologically to understand the actions that lead to donations.

The challenge advisors provided the multiple datasets to my team, each containing data regarding email opens, clicks, bounces, and donations corresponding to a user ID.

The data has shown that there is a correlation between those who precede donations with actions, which include gaining awareness and signing petitions. However, a very small fraction of subscribers are donors.
